    <p class="line">
      Topic nummber one is about the relationship between zeros and polynomials.
      Thankfuly this is simple the relationship between the two is that zeros
      are were polynomials cross or interect the x-axis these are also know as

    <p class="line">
      Here is were it become more difficult for this project because of the
      options aren't as simple as the first. However I have choose and I choose
      using polynomial identities to slove problems. First I shall tell you what
      a polynomial identitie is and they are an equation that are ture for every
      value of a varible.
